Features for a PlaneSpotting App

1. Aircraft Identification (AI-Powered)
Use your CoreML model (PlaneModel.mlmodel) to identify planes based on images taken by users.
Enhance the AI to recognize:
Aircraft type (e.g., Airbus A320, Boeing 747).
Airline (based on livery).
Registration details (optional, if patterns are clear).

2. Flight Tracking
Integrate with public APIs like:
FlightAware, FlightRadar24, or OpenSky Network.
Provide live flight tracking and detailed information:
Aircraft route, altitude, speed, and departure/arrival airports.

3. Community Features
Spotting Logs: Let users save their sightings with photos, location, date, and notes.
Leaderboard: Track and rank users by the number of unique planes they’ve spotted.
Social Sharing: Enable users to share their sightings to social media directly from the app.

4. Augmented Reality (AR) Spotting
Use ARKit to overlay real-time flight details (e.g., plane altitude, destination) when users point their phone at the sky.
Combine AR with CoreML to identify aircraft in real time.

5. Global Database
Build a database of aircraft, airlines, and airports that users can browse.
Provide detailed information for each:
Aircraft: Model specs, history, and photos.
Airlines: Fleet size, base airports, and destinations.

6. Customizable Themes
Use the ThemeManager you’re developing to let users choose between light, dark, or custom themes inspired by airlines or aviation styles.

7. Offline Mode
Allow users to record sightings even when offline, syncing data later when the connection is restored.
Potential Tech Stack
CoreML: For aircraft identification.
ARKit: For augmented reality features.
Combine/SwiftUI: For state management and modern UI design.
Flight APIs: Integrate public APIs like:
OpenSky Network (free, crowd-sourced flight data).
ADS-B Exchange (non-commercial tracking).

Firebase:
User authentication.
Cloud Firestore for storing spotting logs.
Real-time database for community features.
Monetization Options
Free with Premium Features:
Free basic spotting functionality.
Premium subscription for advanced features (AR tracking, live flight data, etc.).

In-App Purchases:
Purchase aircraft spotting guides, detailed airline histories, or special themes.

Community Contributions:
Allow users to contribute to the app’s database (e.g., submitting rare aircraft photos).
Why Planect Could Stand Out

Community-Driven Innovation: Plane enthusiasts love sharing their passion, and a platform like Planect can connect them globally.
AI-Powered Identification: Few apps in this space combine AI with aircraft identification.
Augmented Reality: AR could create a unique and immersive experience for spotters.
